Ronald Wayne (born May 17, 1934) is a retired American electronics industry worker. He co-founded Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) with Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, providing administrative oversight for the new venture. However, he soon sold his share of the new company back to Jobs and Wozniak for 800 U.S. dollars, and later accepted $1,500 to forfeit any claims against Apple (in total, equivalent to $9,514 in 2017). As of August 2, 2018, if Wayne had kept his 10% stake in Apple Inc., it would have been worth over $100 billion,making him the second-richest man in the world.Wayne worked with Steve Jobs at Atari before he, Jobs, and Wozniak founded Apple Computer on April 1, 1976. Serving as the venture's "adult supervision",Wayne drew the first Apple logo, wrote the three men's original partnership agreement,and wrote the Apple I manual.

Wayne received a 10% stake in Apple. Less than two weeks later, on April 12, 1976 he relinquished his equity for US$800.Legally, all members of a partnership are personally responsible for any debts incurred by any partner; unlike Jobs and Wozniak, then 21 and 25, Wayne had personal assets that potential creditors could seize.The failure of a slot machine company he had started five years earlier also contributed to his decision to exit the partnership.

Later in 1976, venture capitalist Arthur Rock and Mike Markkula helped develop an Apple business plan and converted the partnership to a corporation. A year after leaving Apple, Wayne received $1,500 for his agreement to forfeit any claims against the new company.

In 1976, its first year of operations, Apple's sales reached US$174,000. In 1977 sales rose to US$2.7 million, in 1978 to US$7.8 million, in 1980 to US$117 million and in 1982 to US$1 billion. In August 2018, Apple's value exceeded one trillion dollars, making it the most valuable U.S. company by far, and if Wayne had kept his 10% stock until then, it would have been worth tens of billions.

Wayne has stated that he does not regret selling his share of the company as he made the "best decision with the information available to me at the time".He also said he felt the Apple enterprise "would be successful, but at the same time there would be significant bumps along the way and I couldn't risk it. I had already had a rather unfortunate business experience before. I was getting too old and those two were whirlwinds. It was like having a tiger by the tail and I couldn't keep up with these guys."
